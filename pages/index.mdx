# Tristan Jarrett

Hi, I'm Tristan. I enjoy coding, here's a quick introduction about me and what my site is about.

I'm a Front End Developer by title at the moment but I enjoy creating anything from scratch, I created this site to document everything I learn from coding to troubleshooting, I'll add the occasional code snippet for my reference and if it helps you too then that's great! 

If you'd like to get in touch you can do so below, I'd love to work with you or grab a coffee if you are local :)
