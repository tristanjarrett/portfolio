### A brief overview of what Indefinite leave to remain is

Indefinite leave to remain (ILR) also known as permanent residence (PR) is the immigration status granted to people who have already shown a commitment to the UK on a temporary visa.

After a UK visa holder has been living in the UK for a certain period, they can apply for ILR which entitles them to live in the UK for as long as they wish on condition that they are not absent from the country for a period longer than two years.

### My experience obtaining Indefinite leave to remain

I entered the UK back in 2013 on an Ancestral visa and have been living in the UK for over five years now. The process for applying for ILR via this route was relatively simple, however, the requirements for applying were annoying, I had to be living in the UK for five years before I could apply and it cost thousands and thousands of pounds, I also had to do a couple of tests including an English language test and The life in the UK test.

### The English language test

The fact that I had to do an English test to prove my knowledge of the language seemed silly to me as I had been living in the UK for nearly five years and interacting with people on a daily basis, English is also the only language that I can speak fluently as it was what I was brought up on in South Africa, however I can understand the need for somebody who has another language as their primary language. This test cost £150 and all I had to do was have a conversation with somebody at the test centre and I passed.

### The life in the UK test

I didn’t quite understand why anybody had to do this test as everything in it seemed very random and quite frankly if somebody living in the UK from birth had to take the test without studying, he or she would probably fail it.

The test cost me £50 and if you failed it then you had to wait a week before rebooking it, so as you could imagine I didn’t want that to happen and I don’t think I’ve ever studied for a test quite as much as I did for this one. Thankfully I passed this one too.

### Submitting the application

When it finally came time to submit my application, I decided to do it through the premium service centre which would only take one day, and I would be able to walk out knowing if I was successful or not, the cost for this service was £600.

When booking the premium service appointment you can only book 45 days prior to the appointment and not before that, however, when you log in to book the appointment there is barely any slots available, in fact I had to book mine at the service centre in Cardiff (Wales) when I lived in the South East of England, I kept logging into the portal every morning and evening to reschedule the appointment to my local centre in Croydon and luckily there was a cancellation and I grabbed it just before somebody else could, this moved my appointment to after my visa had already expired by a month, but because I had submitted my application online before it had expired it didn’t matter when I went for the interview as long as it was within 45 working days from submitting my application.

### Attending the interview

The day had finally arrived for me to visit the service centre for my interview, once I arrived and took a ticket, I had to wait in a room with about 50–100 other people for my name to be called. Most people had been called through and were waiting for the outcome of their application, but I still sat there nervously. I was eventually called and I went through my application with the officer, then was sent back to wait for the decision.

The officer called me back much sooner than any of the other applicants and this made me really anxious, and so I should have been, the declined my application because when I moved over I was a dependant on my mother’s visa and even though I was over 18 when I applied for ILR, I was still classed as a dependant because that’s what my visa said.

The main reason for the rejection was because my mom had done a postal application because it was cheaper but could take around 6 months for approval and because I was a dependant on her visa and her ILR wasn’t granted yet it meant mine couldn’t be granted.

### Reapplying via post

After spending over £3000 on my first application I was fortunate enough to get most of it refunded for exceptional circumstances, they retained £100 for the appointment that I attended and said they would refund the rest. After months of chasing, I eventually got a refund so that I could apply again via post. I sent my postal application off 3 months after my initial visa had expired but not due to any fault of mine as I explained I could not afford to splash out another £3k and had to wait for the refund that was meant to take 10 working days but instead took 2–3 months.

Today I received an email saying that my Biometric Resident Permit was in the post and that my ILR has been granted. Hooray! I was so pleased and am so excited to get on with my travels.

Thanks for reading, I hope if you ever need to apply that you will not have any issues like this. Avoid the premium service as its simply not worth it unless you have the extra cash laying around.

The total processing time for my application was 2 months and 10 days.
